# The UnHealth Score

I wanted to build a Dashboard related to public health for a portfolio project. 

Eventually, this became [The UnHealth Dashboard](https://bit.ly/UnHealthDashboard). 

It's deployed on Heroku so if the app is asleep it may take about 20 seconds to wake up.

This post is the third in a series, explaining the process of creating the **UnHealth Score**, which allows for direct comparison between counties in one summary statistic.

The GitHub repo for this project is here: [The UnHealth Dashboard Repo](https://github.com/SloughJE/UnHealth_Dashboard/)

## Why?

The dataset I was working with had more than 30 health metrics. In order to compare counties easily, I wanted to make something like an "overall health status score". 

This would also allow me to rank counties based on their overall health status.

I decided to design the score such that a higher value indicates a more unhealthy county, aligning with the nature of most metrics (e.g., higher rates of diabetes indicate worse health).

While this aggregation simplifies comparisons, it also means some nuances of individual metrics are lost. 

I used specific methods to mitigate this, aiming to create a score that reflected the reality and nuance of the underlying data, as much as possible.


## Accounting for Health Measure Impact 

Some health measures were more clearly more impactful than others. 

For example, the measure "No cholesterol screening among adults aged >=18 years" is clearly less impactful than "Coronary heart disease among adults aged >=18 years" on overall county health.

To deal with this, I created an `impact score`, which is simply a number for 1 to 5 (5 being most impactful), indicating the seriousness or impact of the measure on the overall health of the county. The goal was to create a score weighted by each measure's impact. 

How did I determine the impact value for a health measure? 

My 'expert' knowledge, common sense, and logic of course.

Yes, it is subjective. Here are a few examples. 

```python
    "Chronic kidney disease among adults aged >=18 years": 5,
    "Cognitive disability among adults ages >=18 years": 5,
    "Mobility disability among adults aged >=18 years": 4,
    "High blood pressure among adults aged >=18 years": 4,
    "High cholesterol among adults aged >=18 years who have been screened in the past 5 years": 2,
    "Sleeping less than 7 hours among adults aged >=18 years": 2,
    "No dental visit in past year among adults aged >=18 years": 1,
    "No cholesterol screening among adults aged >=18 years": 1
```

Generally I tried to define the health measures that indicated a current health issue as most impactful as opposed to a more preventative type of measure. I am aware that this could indicate serious future health problems however, I feel that this score should reflect the state of the county when the data was gathered. 

## Normalization Procedures

### Within Health Measure Normalization

By "Health Measure" I mean the specific health metric in the data, e.g. `No cholesterol screening among adults`, and the corresponding percent, for each county.

Each health measure's values for all counties are first normalized within their specific health measure group to a scale of 0 to 100. 

In other words, we take the values for all counties' `No cholesterol screening among adults` (e.g. Los Angeles: 34%, Falls Church: 14%, Los Alamos: 11%...) and normalize those values so they range from 0 to 100, instead of just the raw percentages.

**Why is this necessary?**

Let's imagine we have two health metrics: `No cholesterol screening among adults aged >=18 years` and `Chronic kidney disease among adults aged >=18 years`. 

For all counties, the `No cholesterol screening` rate varies from 20% to 75% (hypothetically).
For all counties, the `Chronic kidney disease` rate varies from 2% to 5% (hypothetically).

That means that the in the best performing county, 20% of people have not gotten a cholesterol screening. 

If we calculated a weighted score by just multiplying the percentages by the impact score, the metrics with naturally higher percentages would overwhelm those with lower percentages. 

In other words, even if we weight the `Chronic kidney disease` as a 5 and `No cholesterol screening` as a 1, because the cholesterol screening percentages are up to 75%, that could result in `No cholesterol screening` having much more impact on overall county health. 

So we must first normalize each metric based on the min and max of counties in the dataset for each health measure. 

For `No cholesterol screening`, 20% would be normalized to 0 an 75% would be normalized to 100.

For `Chronic kidney disease`, 2% would be normalized to 0 an 5% would be normalized to 100.

This ensures that all health measures contribute equally to the overall health assessment, regardless of their original value ranges. 

**The math:**

Normalization formula:

$$ 
\begin{equation}
D_{i,j}^{\text{norm}} = \frac{D_{i,j} - \min(D_i)}{\max(D_i) - \min(D_i)} \times 100 
\end{equation}
$$

where:

- D<sub>i,j</sub><sup>norm</sup> is the normalized value of health measure i for county j.
- D<sub>i,j</sub> is the original value of health measure i for county j.
- min(D<sub>i</sub>) is the minimum value of health measure i across all counties.
- max(D<sub>i</sub>) is the maximum value of health measure i across all counties.


### Weighted Score Calculation

Next, each normalized value is multiplied by its respective impact score to calculate the weighted score for each county. 

This step defines the varying importance of different health measures, based on the impact score.

As an example, county Kusilvak, has `No cholesterol screening` value of 35%. After Normalization, it has a value of 91.55 (not actual data). This would be multiplied by 1 (the impact score) to get the `Weighted Score`.


To create the un-normalized UnHealth Score, the weighted scores for each county and each health measure are summed up:

$$ 
\begin{equation}
    W_j = \sum_{i} (D_{i,j}^{\text{norm}} \times w_i) 
\end{equation}
$$

where:

- W<sub>j</sub> is the overall weighted health score for county j.
- D<sub>i,j</sub><sup>norm</sup> is the normalized value of health measure i for county j.
- w<sub>i</sub> is the impact score (weight) of health measure i.
- &Sigma;<sub>i</sub> denotes the summation over all health measures i.


## Overall UnHealth Score Normalization

Now we normalize the scores again to produce the UnHealth Score on a standardized 0 to 100 scale across all counties.

$$ 
\begin{equation}
U_j = \frac{W_j - \min(W)}{\max(W) - \min(W)} \times 100 
\end{equation}
$$

where:

- U<sub>j</sub> is the normalized UnHealth Score for county j.
- W<sub>j</sub> is the overall weighted health score for county j.
- min(W) is the minimum weighted health score among all counties.
- max(W) is the maximum weighted health score among all counties.


Remember, a value of 0 for the UnHealth score means it is the best performing county (least unhealthy) and 100 means it is the worst performing county (most unhealthy).

Extending our example, with the county Kusilvak, we can imagine that adding up the weighted scores for all the health measures of this county results in the value of 7,5668.35. 

After we do that for all counties, we normalize that data from 0 to 100. 

Our final UnHealth score for Kusilvak county could be 100, indicating that Kusilvak has the highest UnHealth Score of all counties.

Now we can compare all counties health status based on one metric: The UnHealth Score.

## Visualization of the Components of the UnHealth Score

In the UnHealth Dashboard, I include a County tab which looks at the data in detail for a specific county. 

The details include data on all the health measures for a chosen county, and how they contribute to the UnHealth Score. 

<img src="media/2024-06-10/unhealth_breakdown.png" alt="UnHealth Score Breakdown" title="UnHealth Score Breakdown">

This screenshot shows the data for Kusilvak. The left horizontal bar chart shows the actual percentages for each health measure, color coded by category. Category comes directly from the CDC data, indicating the health category of the specific health measure.

The stacked bar chart on the right shows how these categories contribute to the overall UnHealth Score. 

Here, the UnHealth Score is 100. The category of Health Risk Behaviors contributes 9.21 points to this value. Health Outcomes contributes 43.25 points. 

Note that I am not using `Categories` in the calculation. They are only shown here to make it easier to see what contributes to the UnHealth Score. 

If you hover over an individual health measure, you can see in the tooltip (as shown in the screenshot above) how much that individual health measure contributes to the UnHealth Score.

Here, you can see that 42.8% of adults in Kusilvak currently smoke, and this contributes 4.04 points to the UnHealth score for this county.

The UnHealth Score of 100 for Kusilvak indicates that it is the least healthy county in the United States based on the UnHealth Score. 

By looking at this breakdown, we can see in detail why this is the case. 

## A Note on Using Summary Statistics

While it obviously makes for easy comparisons, summary statistics can have real drawbacks. Here are some:

For example, a county might have an extremely high rate of diabetes but low rates for other health issues. The summary score might not adequately highlight this specific problem, which could be crucial for targeted health interventions.

Somewhat similarly, it could mask variability within the data. A county with moderate scores across all health metrics might receive a similar overall score to a county with very high and very low values across different metrics. This could lead to a misinterpretation of the health landscape.

The weighting and normalization process might unintentionally give more importance to certain metrics over others. This can skew the overall score and potentially lead to biased conclusions or decisions. Impact scores are subjective. Determining more objective impact scores may be possible, but could be very difficult to obtain data to create them. 

There are definitely more drawbacks. These are just a few. 

I included the possibility to look at the actual data for each measure, as, even though that takes more time, that is the only way to understand the nuances of the county's health status as best as possible, given the data we have.

That was the creation of the UnHealth Score.

I hope it makes sense and that it helps understand the overall health status of a county.

And perhaps some of the benefits and drawbacks of aggregating multiple metrics into one.
