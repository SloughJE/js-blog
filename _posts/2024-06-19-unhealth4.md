# The AI Patient Analysis

I wanted to build a Dashboard related to public health for a portfolio project. 

Eventually, this became [The UnHealth Dashboard](https://bit.ly/UnHealthDashboard). 

It's deployed on Heroku so if the app is asleep it may take about 20 seconds to wake up.

This post is the fourth in a series, explaining the process of creating the **AI Patient Analysis**...

The GitHub repo for this project is here: [The UnHealth Dashboard Repo](https://github.com/SloughJE/UnHealth_Dashboard/)

## What does it do?

It generates patient summaries by combining individual health records with county-level health statistics. 

The summary is a holistic view of a patient's health by analyzing various health indicators, personal medical history, local UnHealth Scores and local health measures. It aims to give doctors a quick yet comprehensive overview, highlighting critical health events and ongoing health conditions.

In other words, we combine data from the patient's health records with local public health context to come up with a comprehensive summary for a doctor. 

## Why an AI Patient Summary?

- to see how well GPT could do this
- to obtain some experience working with electronic health records
- to get on the ***AI Hype Train***

### The "AI" Hype Train

I did hesitate to call this an "AI" based summary. The current popular use of the term is not what it used to be. It used to be much broader, encompassing anything from rule-based systems to machine learning. Now it seems to just mean either generative AI, text generation / image generation that is stupid/censored/lying/conscious or some type of technology that will wipe out humans in a 'smart' way, depending on the services being marketed.

<img src="media/2024-06-19/ifthen.webp" alt="if-then" title="It's really if then">


Anyway...perhaps more on that later.

I suppose LLM Patient Summary doesn't have the same ring to it. So, "AI" it is.

## Synthea - Synthetic Realistic Patient Health Records

To demonstrate the feasibility of the AI Patient Summary, I needed to find some patient health data.

Obviously I could not use real patient health records so I found the next best thing. Simulated, realistic health records.

The patient health records are generated from [Synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea), an advanced simulation tool that creates 'realistic (but not real)', synthetic patient histories. Synthea's data encompasses comprehensive medical histories, including medications, allergies, medical encounters, and social determinants of health, all generated through statistical models to reflect real-world variability and complexity.

```bash
Synthea features include:

    - Birth to Death Lifecycle
    - Configuration-based statistics and demographics (defaults with Massachusetts Census data)
    - Primary Care Encounters, Emergency Room Encounters, and Symptom-Driven Encounters
    - Conditions, Allergies, Medications, Vaccinations, Observations/Vitals, Labs, Procedures, CarePlans
    - Formats
        - HL7 FHIR (R4, STU3 v3.0.1, and DSTU2 v1.0.2)
        - Bulk FHIR in ndjson format (set exporter.fhir.bulk_data = true to activate)
        - C-CDA (set exporter.ccda.export = true to activate)
        - CSV (set exporter.csv.export = true to activate)
        - CPCDS (set exporter.cpcds.export = true to activate)
```

The data generated from Synthea includes patient demographic data such as the county they live in, which I used to combine the patient data with the already created [UnHealth Scores](https://www.jsdatascience.com/blog/posts/unhealth3/) and health metrics from our original CDC PLACES data. 

### Synthea Data Generation

For some reason, when trying to generate data for more than one patient at a time, Synthea defaults to setting their location to Massachusets. But you can generate a patient from a random state. 

ie if you run the command to generate data for 1000 patients:
```bash 
run_synthea -p 1000
```
they automatically all come from Massachusets. And it's relatively quick. I think just a minute or so. 

However if you generate data for a patient from a state using the command:
```bash
run_synthea Alaska
```
it generates data for 1 patient in Alaska, in a random county. 
This took almost as much time as generating 1000 patients. 

As far as I could tell, there was no way to generate data for 1000 patients from random locations.

So I wrote a script to randomly generate a state, then generate data for a patient in that state using Synthea, for an input number of patients.

This did take a while to process, so I parallelized it. [Forked Repo of Synthea](https://github.com/SloughJE/synthea) with script to do this in `run_synthea_python/run_parallel_synthea.py` 

After figuring that out, I had to ready the output to send to the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo API.

## Converting Electronic Health Records to Text-based Format

GPT does better when sending text data to it, versus multiple, potentially large CSVs. I needed to convert all the patient data to a text-based format.

I set the Synthea parameters to output CSVs of all the patient data. This included files like allergies, careplans, claims_transactions, conditions, encounters...etc. I was not interested in the financial data, just the health records. This left me with these files:
`allergies, careplans, conditions, encounters, immunizations, medications, procedures, observations, patient_info`.

Here is an example from 2 of these files (not the same patients):

**Allergies**

Again, this is **not** real data, just realistic looking data. 

From all this data, I created a ['text-based'](https://github.com/SloughJE/UnHealth_Dashboard/blob/production/src/data/patient_data.py) record for a patient. This includes:
- Summary of patient demographic data (age, gender, race, ethnicity).
- Summary of medical conditions recorded in the last five years.
- List of current medications, and a history of past medications with usage counts and year ranges.
- List of current and past allergies.
- Summary of care plan history by type and year.
- Summary of healthcare encounters by type and year range, highlighting the latest encounter.
- Summary of immunization history by type and year.
- List of the latest lab results, prioritizing certain labs and avoiding duplicates.
- List of local health measures and an overall health summary for the patientâ€™s location.

An example of a patient's data in a text-based form:

```
Patient Demographics:
- Age: 63
- Gender: F
- Race: white, Ethnicity: nonhispanic

Medical Conditions (Last 5 Years):
- Part-time employment (finding) (from 2019-07-09 to 2021-07-20)
- Social isolation (finding) (from 2019-07-09 to 2020-07-14)
- Stress (finding) (from 2020-07-14 to 2021-07-20)
- ...
Care Plan History by Type and Year:
- Diabetes self management plan: 1 times (1986)
Latest Lab Results:
- Calcium [Mass/volume] in Blood: 9.7 mg/dL
- Carbon dioxide  total [Moles/volume] in Blood: 20.5 mmol/L
- Chloride [Moles/volume] in Blood: 103.8 mmol/L
- Cholesterol [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma: 199.5 mg/dL
- ...
Local Health Measures:
- All teeth lost (>=65): 0.12 (Rank: 1135)
- Any disability (>=18): 0.37 (Rank: 2622)
- Arthritis (>=18): 0.25 (Rank: 1603)
- ...
Local Health Summary:
- Location: Harrison, Mississippi
- Population: 211044.0
- Per Capita Income: $46211.0
- UnHealth Score: 37.03 (Rank: 1879)
```

This patient data is combined with a prompt the tells GPT what the input data is, what the output summary should consist of and who it is for.

Extract of the [prompt](https://github.com/SloughJE/UnHealth_Dashboard/blob/production/src/data/prompt.py):

```
Objective: To provide a comprehensive and concise summary of a patient's medical history, current health status, and relevant public health data from their county, facilitating informed and personalized care during a consultation with a GP Medical Doctor.

Please format the summary as follows:
- Ensure that each section starts with a clear heading formatted as a heading (H2), followed by a colon (e.g., ##Patient Demographics and Background:).
- Use **bold** for key terms and important health conditions.
- Use *italic* for any advice or recommendations.
- Under each heading, list relevant points as bullet points.
- For the Local Public Health Context, start with a brief introduction to the county's health status, followed by bullet points for relevant specific measures, especially given the patient's history. The Local Health Measures state the prevalence of a health status in proportion (higher is more unhealthy), with their absolute_contribution to the UnHealth Score, and the rank per county. The (>=18) indicates the age range. The Local Health Summary states the UnHealth Score and rank. 
- Conclude the summary with a clear call to action or next steps under the "Preparation for Consultation" heading.
```

Look I'm a ***prompt engineer!***

### OpenAI API


Once I had both the prompt and text-based patient data, I could send them the OpenAI API, one patient at a time, and save the response along with the patient ID.

I could have allowed the dashboard to call the API live, but every call costs some $. Instead, the user can randomly select a patient in the database and view their previously generated AI Summary.

### Lab Metrics
In the dashboard I also wanted to show some labs for the patient, to provide more detail than just the AI summary. 

I had to do some extra processing on the patient lab data, as there were often way too many labs, duplicate labs but with different units or method of measurement, etc. In short I:
- Filtered labs to include only a predefined list of important labs (as determined by myself).
- Determined priority for lab descriptions (e.g., "in Serum or Plasma" > "in Blood" > others).
- Extracted the most important labs per patient based on priority and date (some were way too old).
- Simplified lab descriptions by removing specifics about the medium (e.g., "in Serum or Plasma")

## Results
Here are some screenshot from the dashboard's AI Patient Summary Tab:


<img src="media/2024-06-19/AI_summary1.png" alt="AI Summary" title="Demographics">

<img src="media/2024-06-19/AI_summary2.png" alt="AI Summary" title="Local Health Context">

<img src="media/2024-06-19/BP.png" alt="Blood Pressure" title="Blood Pressure">

The first screenshot shows some of the AI Patient Summary regarding the patient's demographics and background. The second one displays the local health context and overall recommendations. The third screenshot shows the patient's blood pressure over time. 

### Is it Useful?

Yes, I think so. Mostly because it provides a well-formatted summary of the patient's history, with location based public health context, *quickly*. 

Of course a doctor could read through all the patient's health records, but this would take much longer and necessitate more brain power. I imagine the doctor would prefer spending mental energy on directly interacting with the patient, rather than going through pages and pages of history looking for the most important points. 

I know, the AI could miss something. But as I wrote in the information pop up on the dashboard: 
    
    â€¢ the AI summary is intended to augment clinical judgment
    â€¢ AI summaries complement but do not replace clinical judgment
    â€¢ Always corroborate AI suggestions with professional guidelines
    â€¢ AI-generated content is advisory and based on available data

If doctors had as much time as they wanted with patients, perhaps this wouldn't be necessary however, I still think it could be a useful tool even in that scenario. 

### Is it Correct?

At least from all the summaries and data I looked through, I could not find instances where it was 'incorrect'. Some cases were a little strange, but these cases appeared to stem from the Synthea data sometimes not being exactly realistic.

That was the creation of the ***AI Patient Analysis***.

I hope it helps you understand how and why I created it, and that it demonstrates a potential use-case in medical practice.

Did I add to the ***AI Hype Train***??
